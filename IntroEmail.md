# Invitation to the Basic IT training

Dear training participant,

you are registered to participate in the upcoming Basic-IT-Training.
To facilitate a smooth start of the training, we would like to give
you some information up front.

## Training Material

You can already view the training material now and also at any point
after the training as it is freely available on GitLab.

Just access
<https://gitlab.internal.d-fine.dev/trainings/basis-it-training/-/wikis/home>
to view the training material.

## Self study

Since from day one the training material will always and completely be
available to you, you can decide on your working schedule yourself and go
through the chapters and exercises at your own pace. The training material is
designed to allow a high degree of self study. However, in case you have any
questions or problems, a trainer will always be available for feedback and
support. As a rule of thumb, if you encounter a problem you should spend about
10-15 minutes studying the training material and researching online to figure
out if you will be able to solve the problem yourself, before you consult one
of the trainers.
This simply helps to not overwhelm the trainers with questions
and for you to not spend too much time on a problem which can potentially be
solved quickly.

## Remote vs on-site

We would like to leave the desicion on where to work on the training up to you.
You can either stay at home and use the described digital tools to
communicate with your trainers and colleagues, or meet in groups in
one of the d-fine offices.

__Note__: If you come to one of the d-fine offices please inform yourself
about and follow the current restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Meetings

To facilitate communication with the trainers as well as with the other
training participants we plan to conduct the following meetings:

- Kick-off meeting; Monday 9-10am
  - Welcome all training participants
  - Explain basics of the training
  - Answer initial questions
- Daily meeting; Tuesday-Friday 9-9:15am and 2-2:15pm
  - Sync up with other training participants
- Closing meeting; Friday 4-5pm
  - Answer final questions
  - Collect feedback

## Trainers

Your trainers for this training will be

- Trainer 1
- Trainer 2

While this training has a strong focus on self study, at least one of your
trainers will always be available to answer questions that you might have
between 9:00 and 18:00 with a one hour lunch break to be agreed in the kick-off
meeting.

To ask a question we encourage you to post it in the main MS Teams channel
so everyone can profit from the answer.
