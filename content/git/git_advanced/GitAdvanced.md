This section covers advanced topics of git such as branching and merging. The
goal is to help you build a mental model of how git branching works and teach
you the basics of how to use branches. The topics are broken down into the
following 3 sections:

## Git Branches

- What are branches and tags
- Creating branches and tags
- Switching branches
- Deleting branches

See [Branches](./Branches).

## Git Merge

- What is a merge?
- Dealing with merge conflicts
- Merge strategies

See [Merging](./Merging).

## Exercise

- Exercises for self evaluation

See [Exercise](./Exercises).

## Helpful Tool

Since the various Git commands and their effects on the commit tree can be hard
to comprehend at first, we recommend having a look at
[this](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) webpage.
With this tool you can try out various git commands you have learned in this
chapter (and also some you will learn in the next chapter) and directly see
their effects on your commit tree. This graphical representation might help
to understand some commands better or to solve a particularly difficult git
problem more easily.
